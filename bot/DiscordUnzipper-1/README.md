# Discord Bot Deployment Guide

## Important Notice
I was unable to access the contents of the zip file "full gen bot.zip" due to file reading/decoding issues. To help you run your Discord bot, please:

1. Extract the zip file contents manually on your system
2. Ensure you have:
   - The main bot Python file
   - Any configuration files
   - requirements.txt (if present)

## General Steps to Run a Discord Bot

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If requirements.txt exists
pip install discord.py  # If no requirements.txt
